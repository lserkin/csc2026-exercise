### 4. Running the notebooks for each exercise

Once the download is complete, you will see yourself within a directory named **`csc2026-exerise`**.  

I have created a draft notebook (.ipynb file) for each exercise, launch it (click) and a new window will be opened.  

These notebooks use new data files that you can browse by opening them in SWAN.
